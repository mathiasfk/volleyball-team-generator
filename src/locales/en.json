    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "How does the team draw work?",
        "answer": "The algorithm evenly distributes players across teams by considering skill levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) and special positions (Libero, Setter). This ensures balanced and competitive teams, and also makes sure everyone plays roughly the same number of games."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are skill levels?",
        "answer": "Skill levels help balance teams. Beginner (weight 0.5) represents players who are new to volleyball, Intermediate (weight 1) for players with moderate experience, and Advanced (weight 1.5) for experienced players. The algorithm uses these weights to distribute overall team strength fairly."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does 'keep team' mean?",
        "answer": "When redrawing, you can choose to keep one of the teams (Red or Blue) and only reorganize the other team and the bench. This is useful when a game has finished and you want to keep the winning team intact."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I edit participants?",
        "answer": "Click the 'Edit' button (pencil icon) next to any participant's name in the list. You can change their name, skill level, and position. Changes are saved automatically."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my data saved?",
        "answer": "Yes! All participants and drawn teams are automatically saved in your browser (localStorage). Your data will remain even if you close and reopen the page."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does it work offline?",
        "answer": "Yes! This is a PWA (Progressive Web App) that works completely offline after the first load. You can install it: on Android/Chrome (tap menu ⋮ > 'Add to Home screen'), on iOS/Safari (tap Share > 'Add to Home Screen'), or on Desktop (click the install icon in the address bar)."
